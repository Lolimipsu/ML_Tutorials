    "   - While more passengers survived in the '0-1' category in absolute numbers, the proportion of survivors was higher among those with 1-2 siblings/spouse.\n",
    "   - To assess survival rates, consider the percentage of survivors within each category:\n",
    "     - For '0-1': Survival rate ≈ 34%\n",
